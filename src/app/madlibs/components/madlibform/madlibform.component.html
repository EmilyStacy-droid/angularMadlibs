            You felt <b>{{firstAdj}}</b> while checking the baby Yoda meme on a Saturday morning.
            
            While you took a break from the memes, <b>{{firstVerb}} </b> and thinking about the importance of memes in your life,you got an email from Tim.

            In the email Tim said you did a/an <b>{{secondAdj}} </b> job on your UNO project and he wanted to talk to you on Monday.

            On Monday, you walked <b>{{firstAdv}} </b> into Timâ€™s office. It turned out Tim just wanted to give you a birthday surprise and invited you to play a UNO game.

            After the UNO project you had a complicated feeling about the UNO game, so you could not help but <b>{{secondVerb}} </b> the UNO cards in front of him.
